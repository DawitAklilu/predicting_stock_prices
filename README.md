# predicting_stock_prices
CMSE 202 capstone project on predicting stock prices using ML

# Question
Can you predict better than a coin flip (in other words 50/50) whether tomorrow’s price will be higher or lower than today’s price?

# Usage
We explored four different models to find the most effective solution.
* SVM Model - data/Direction.ipynb
* RNN with LSTM - Better_stock_code.ipynb
* Logistic Regression - Final_model_Christian Anovert.ipynb
* GP Model - genetic/gplearn_results.ipynb

To look at the results, navigate to each notebook file and open in your favorite IDE.

# Contributions
* Navid - SVM Model
* Dawit - RNN with LSTM
